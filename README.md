As heard and watched videos, Context Api is not an easy deal and which took me a lot of time to grab the concepts. I have watched through lot of recommnded videos and documents as part of learning and practicing that how an I process the changes in my existing shoe project of task-20 and here I am submiting my project as I have finally made it as expected. So, what I have learned and understood is how to use Context Api in React and why is it necessary and that helps in my decision making.
